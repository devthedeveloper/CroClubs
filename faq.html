All of our forthcoming phases will have different themes. We would like to create a connected community instead of creating inflation in the NFT market. Creating unique art with a high number of NFTs is challenging. Due to these factors, our first collection supply is very limited. We will release at least 4 collections with 1111 pieces on each. All of them will be aligned with our story to create a gaming ecosystem with unique clubs/clans mechanisms and an interesting game space.</p>

                                                    <p>No. We believe that whitelisting or queue skipping are tools to mint a high number of collections in the NFT ecosystem. We are creating one of the rarest collections and we do not offer whitelist prices. We will do several giveaways to our community before the mint but we believe all of our future investors need the same amount to invest in our project. Whitelisting also affects the floor price and encourages people to sell their investment on the first day. Our project is a rewarding and P2E ecosystem and we need sustainable floor prices for our investors. </p>

                                                    <p>We are making a detailed roadmap of our project. There are several pillars of our roadmap: P2E game, holder benefits, community activities and so on. Our roadmap will be proactive and could change depending on the community’s decisions. The NFT ecosystem has different boosters at different times, so we plan to adapt our roadmap accordingly and inform all our holders of the updates. Staking, P2E gaming, farm boosting, royalty share, buyback and burn are all methods and activities you could see in our roadmap. You can check our roadmap on our website and also in the discord channel.</p>
