                                        conduct an experiment of a newly found bio-warfare weapon. </p>

                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="0.8s">The lead scientist Dr. Corso, the mad genius of genetic engineering,
                                        had created a toxic stem cell which would attack the subject's body in
                                        a gruesome speed, leaving behind only a decayed body. The plan, if
                                        the experiment was indeed a success, was to use robotically guided
                                        bees to perform the injection for messes. It was the perfect weapon
                                        and it was time to test it on a human subject.</p>

                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="0.8s">When it struck 00:00 hours on the clock, government officials, a team
                                        of scientists led by Dr. Corso and a team of capable soldiers had
                                        already come together in the secret military base. Subject was a
                                        political convict and had no idea what was coming her way.</p>

                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="0.8s">After all the security precautions were made to ensure that it was
                                        indeed a controlled environment, Dr. Corso got the injection needle in
                                        his hand, entered the bio-isolator chamber the subject was kept in and
                                        started pushing the contents of it into the convict's blood stream,
                                        unknowing that he was sealing humanity's fate.</p>

                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Once the injection was completed it was so quick for decay to spread
                                        all around its host's body, consuming it inside out. The whole thing
                                        took only 2 minutes to be done with. It was a success, and pure joy
                                        followed. There would be no stopping Perdita with this weapon by
                                        their side. All of their enemies would be gone in just 2 minutes.</p>

                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Shrieks of joy were greedly mixing with laughter. But it didn’t last long.
                                        It was cut short with the eerie sound coming from the rotten body. It
                                        was almost like a hum. One soldier swore that he saw it moved even.</p>

                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="0.8s">All joy fell silent. Every single eye was fixed on the humming corpse.
                                        They began closing in on it, step by step. And there it was, a brief
                                        movement of the arm. Brief but clear as day. Something went terribly
                                        wrong. Dr. Corso was in awe. He swore that nothing like this ever
                                        happened on the non-human subjects. “Something in human biology
                                        must be reacting differently than non-humans when exposed to the
                                        stem cell. But this is just an after effect, the subject is very much dead,
                                        I can assure you of that.” said Dr. Corso. “If you can just unlock the
                                        chamber, I will examine her and show you that all is good.”</p>

                                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="0.8s">Timidly, a couple of soldiers neared the chamber, unlocked and
                                        opened the door. A gutless 5 seconds went by before
                                        Dr. Corso could take his first step. But at the first sight of a movement
                                        creature came to life. It was brute and unmerciful. The soldier nearest
                                        to it had no chance. The creature swooped right on him and took a
                                        huge chunk of his neck. Others on the other hand started shooting at it
                                        but whatever they did, the creature was still standing. No weapon
                                        known to humankind could kill it. In the blink of an eye everyone at the
                                        sight had been attacked. Everyone but Dr. Corso who had hid
                                        underneath the piling dead bodies. He waited until the creature
                                        satisfied its apparent hunger for human flesh and then disappeared
                                        into the darkness. He slowly emerged out of the pile, trying to make
                                        sense of what had just occurred, what he had done, but he was cut
                                        short in his thoughts as he saw movements from the dead. He ran and
                                        ran and ran. But to no end. The dead didn't stay dead, they spread.
                                        Only in a few weeks the infection, now known as the zombie outbreak,
                                        became a global pandemic.</p>
